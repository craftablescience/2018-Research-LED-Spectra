Welcome, future starter!

In this guide I will tell you how to continue my work in the magical and mysterious world of LEDs.
First you'll need to know how to set up your workspace.

--- MATERIALS ---

You will need the stuff in the top right drawer in my previous workspace. There will be two cardboard boxes:
one with a FRAGILE NONBENDABLE SHATTERABLE FIBERGLASS cord which you don't want to
bend further than it is in the box, and another box with everything else you need.
Open both and take out:

- FRAGILE NONBENDABLE SHATTERABLE FIBERGLASS cord
- 9-volt battery
- Resistance board
- A cube thingy thats really heavy for its size
- A pole with a small LED adapter (the pole screws into the cube thingy to make a stand)
- The LED case, has all the LEDs (you will be using the small LEDs)
- The spectrometer
- The cabinet (a large box with a snaplock)
- Assorted wires

--- SETUP ---

Take the long end of the big black wire, and put it into the black receptacle in the resistance board.
The other end clips onto the negative side of the 9-volt battery (the indented side, not the raised side).
The green wire clips onto the red receptacle in the resistance board.
The red wire clips onto the positive side of the battery (the raised side, not the indented side).
Now, if you clip the red wire to a long LED leg, and the green wire to a short LED leg, it should light up!
If it doesn't light up, or it explodes, or if it briefly flickers then emits a "puff" noise and goes out,
you did something incorrectly.
Next, take the FRAGILE NONBENDABLE SHATTERABLE FIBERGLASS cord and put the rectangle end into the spectrometer,
with the arrows facing away from the white sun image. Take the other end, and put it into the LED adapter on that
stand you set up earlier (pole with adapter on top screws into heavy cube thing). Take all this, and put it into the
cabinet.

--- CONCLUSION ---

Well. You're done with setup!
My project was about how LEDs all had unique spectra.
