A blind test, to check the accuracy of our methods at identifying LEDs based purely on spectra.
A key to identify the LEDs is as follows:

--- KEY ---

"B" and "BB" are 6 scans of the same LED. They are the original label.
"D" and "DD" are 6 scans of the same LED. They are under a different label.

 B1  ->  D8
 B2  ->  D2
 B3  ->  D4
 B4  ->  D9
 B5  ->  D1
 B6  ->  D3
 B7  ->  D5
 B8  ->  D7
 B9  ->  D6
 B10 -> D10

--- SPECS ---

10 Blue LEDs were scanned 12 times (6 with original labels, 6 with mixed labels).
